# Data-Visualisation-on-Personalized-Leaning-Dataset-using-Python-libraries
This project analyzes a **Personalized Learning Dataset** to understand student behavior, academic engagement, and dropout likelihood using Python. It uses data science techniques to extract insights and develop an interactive dashboard for educators to monitor and support student performance.

🔍 Objective: The primary goals of this project include:

- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Creating a custom Engagement Score
- Studying learning styles and academic success
- Testing statistical hypotheses (T-Test, Chi-Square)
- Identifying key dropout factors
- Designing an interactive dashboard for educators

🧠 Technologies & Libraries Used: 

- Python
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Plotly** – Interactive graphing
- **Dash** – Web-based dashboard creation
- **SciPy** – Statistical analysis
